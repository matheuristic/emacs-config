* About

Snippets that can be copied into ~$HOME/.emacs.d/lisp/init-local.el~
for machine-local configuration.

The following is a template for local configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; init-local.el --- Emacs local config file -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs configuration that is machine-local, typically loaded before
;; the Customize file.

;; This file should be located at lisp/init-local.el within
;; `user-emacs-directory', typically ~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-local.el

;;; Code:

;; ... machine-local configuration goes here ...

(provide 'init-local)
;;; init-local.el ends here

* Display face fonts

Set the fonts used for display faces.

There are a few main display faces many other faces inherit from:
- ~default~: The main display face, everything inherits from this directly or
  indirectly unless otherwise specified.
- ~fixed-pitch~: For specific cases where a fixed-pitch
  (i.e. monospace) font is expected.
- ~variable-pitch~: For specific cases where a variable-pitch
  (i.e. proportional) font is expected.
- ~mode-line~: Mode line face for active buffers.
- ~mode-line-inactive~: Mode line face for inactive buffers.

Also set a fallback font for filling gaps in character coverage in the
display face fonts using ~set-fontset-font~,
which has the function signature
~(set-fontset-font NAME TARGET FONT-SPEC &optional FRAME ADD)~.
The key observations here are that:
- When ~NAME~ is ~t~, this is applied to the default fontset.
- When ~TARGET~ is ~nil~, ~FONT-SPEC~ is used for missing characters
  (if it has that character).
- When ~ADD~ is ~append~, then this font is added to the end of the
  fontset which means it will be searched for a matching character
  glyph after all other fonts in the set.

For a list of good free or open-source fonts, see this [[https://github.com/matheuristic/dotfiles/blob/master/font_notes.org][link]].
For more information about fonts and fontsets in Emacs, see this [[https://idiocy.org/emacs-fonts-and-fontsets.html][link]].
Run ~(font-family-list)~ to get a list of available font families.

If using a large font, it is also a good idea to set
~inhibit-compacting-font-caches~ to ~t~ which avoids garbage
collecting font caches. This mitigates scenarios where the font is
removed from the cache and reloaded again during redisplay which can
slow down the redisplay.

                    :height (if (eq system-type 'darwin) 160 110)

For some fonts, an alternative character may be preferable to the
standard character show for some symbol code.
In those instances, the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Active-Display-Table.html#Active-Display-Table][standard display table]] can be modified to
display replace characters of a given code with characters of a
different one.
An example is shown below.

#+begin_example
;; the following displays '0' using '\ue007' (private slashed zero in B612 font)
(setq standard-display-table (make-display-table))
(aset standard-display-table ?0 [?])
#+end_example

* Language Server Protocol

[[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][Emacs Polyglot]] (or eglot) is an Emacs Language Server Protocol client.
It is more lightweight than [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]], though also with less features.

- Compose output from multiple eldoc documentation functions instead
  of only using the first one which is the default behavior ([[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/648][link]]).
- ~C-c l~ invokes an eglot transient globally.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; lightweight LSP client
(use-package eglot
  :config
  ;; increase wait time after last change before asking for
  ;; completions from 0.5s to 2s to reduce request rate
  (setq eglot-send-changes-idle-time 2))

;; compose outputs from eldoc doc functions in Eglot managed buffers
(with-eval-after-load 'eldoc
  (with-eval-after-load 'eglot
    (add-hook 'eglot--managed-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (when (boundp 'eldoc-documentation-strategy)
                  (setq-local eldoc-documentation-strategy #'eldoc-documentation-compose))))))

* Python

- Enable Flymake mode when editing Python files.
- Add Imenu entry to the menubar in ~python-mode~ buffers.
- Use ~jedi-language-server~ ([[https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server][link]]) in Eglot for Python buffers. Since
  ~jedi-language-server~ smartly handles virtual environments, it is
  fine to install it outside of a development environment (e.g., for
  conda it can be installed in some ~jedi-ls~ environment with the
  ~jedi-language-server~ binary symlinked to a directory in ~$PATH~).
- When in a Python buffer, ~C-c m~ invokes a mode-specific transient
  (configured in ~init.el~).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; enable `flymake-mode' in `python-mode' buffers
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'flymake-mode t)

;; add Imenu index to menubar
(with-eval-after-load 'imenu

(with-eval-after-load 'eglot
  (setf (alist-get 'python-mode eglot-server-programs) '("jedi-language-server")))
#+end_src

* R

R support is provided by [[https://ess.r-project.org/][Emacs Speaks Statistics]], more commonly known
by its abbreviation ESS ([[https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS][Github]]).

- Install the [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lintr/index.html][lintr]] and [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/styler/index.html][styler]] CRAN packages
  #+begin_src R
  install.packages("lintr")
  install.packages("styler")
  #+end_src
- Linting via Flycheck or Flymake uses the [[https://github.com/r-lib/lintr][lintr]] R package, and
  sometimes manual creation the =~/.R/lintr_cache~= directory is
  needed (see [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/53018/flycheck-r-lintr-doesnt-find-anything][StackOverflow issue]]).
- ~M--~ inserts ~<-~ in ~ess-mode~ and ~inferior-ess-mode~.
- ~C-S-m~ inserts ~%>%~ followed by a new line in ~ess-mode~ and
  ~inferior-ess-mode~.
- [[https://github.com/ShuguangSun/ess-r-insert-obj][ess-r-insert-obj]] provides utilities for inserting variable and
  column names or their values in ESS-R.
- [[https://github.com/ShuguangSun/ess-r-insert-obj][ess-r-insert-obj]] provides utilities for inserting variable and
  column names or their values in ESS-R.
- [[https://github.com/polymode/poly-R/][poly-R]] provides better support for R Markdown and bookdown files,
  leveraging [[https://github.com/polymode/polymode][polymode]] to have different major modes be active for
  different buffer regions.
- Code reformatting is done using the ~reformatter-define~ macro from
  the ~reformatter~ package, which defines two interactive commands
  ~r-styler-format-buffer~ and ~r-styler-format-region~ (only works on
  top-level objects) along with the local minor mode
  ~r-styler-format-on-save-mode~ that uses [[https://github.com/r-lib/styler][styler]] to format the code
  in the buffer.
- When in an R buffer, ~C-c m~ invokes a mode-specific transient.

* Racket

[[https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode][racket-mode]] provides a major mode for editing [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]] buffers.

* Go

- Support for Go buffers
- Add Imenu entry to the menubar in ~go-mode~ buffers
- Install ~gopls~ which is usable with Eglot by running
  ~GO111MODULE=on go get golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest~
- When in a Go buffer, ~C-c m~ invokes a mode-specific transient.

* Common Lisp

- Support for Common Lisp files using [[https://github.com/joaotavora/sly][SLY]] (fork of [[https://slime.common-lisp.dev/][SLIME]])
- The first available implementation among [[https://github.com/roswell/roswell][Roswell]] (an implementation
  manager), [[http://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]] and [[https://ccl.clozure.com/][Clozure CL]] is used
- When in a Common Lisp buffer, ~C-c m~ invokes a mode-specific
  transient.
- TODO
  - [[https://github.com/mmgeorge/sly-asdf][sly-asdf]] (support for editing [[https://asdf.common-lisp.dev/][ASDF]] systems)
  - [[https://github.com/joaotavora/sly-quicklisp][sly-quicklisp]] ([[https://www.quicklisp.org/][Quicklisp]] support)
  - [[https://github.com/joaotavora/sly-macrostep][sly-macrostep]] (expand macros within the source file, may not be needed)
