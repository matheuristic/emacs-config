;;; Commentary:

;; Minor mode for censoring buffer content.

;; `censor-mode' toggles censoring of the current buffer.

;; `global-censor-mode' toggles censoring of all buffers that match
;; the regexps or satisfy the predicate functions in `censor-include'.

;; Censoring is purely visual, so yanking text works normally. This
;; mode is useful in screen sharing or pair coding sessions to ensure
;; content in sensitive buffers is hidden should they get displayed.

;; censor.el is forked from conceal https://github.com/lepisma/conceal
;; and modified to support buffer-local censoring in addition to the
;; global buffer censoring from the original package, and to support a
;; `recentf-exclude' style definition of what buffers to censor when
;; the global minor mode is enabled.
